# CALDERA plugin: Adversary

**This plugin has not been completely tested since this code has been upgraded.**

This plugin contains:
* The original CALDERA mode in plugin form
* This includes multiple REST API endpoints, an agent and a RAT and a GUI component. 

This plugin will allow you to run operations on Windows hosts only.

## Requirements

To use this plugin, you must have a Mongo database installed and running locally.
Detailed MongoDB Server installation instructions can be found here: 
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition-installation-tutorials

This plugin also requires that you load the GUI plugin with it.

## BSF

Operations run through the Adversary Plugin generate logs in the BRAWL Shared Format (BSF). More information about 
this format can be found <a href="https://github.com/mitre/brawl-public-game-001#bsf">here</a>. Please note 
that CALDERA's BSF download produces an ordered collection of BSF objects (other header information, such as 'game_id' 
and 'bsf_version', is handled elsewhere). Excerpts from an example CALDERA generated BSF log are documented here as an 
example of how to read and reference the format.
